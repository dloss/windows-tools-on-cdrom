Windows-Tools on CD-ROM (or USB stick)
======================================

*This list has not been updated since 2007. Links may not work. Use a
search engine of your choice.*

Having created several bootable Windows CD-ROMs with [Bart's PE
Builder](http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/), I thought how nice it would be
if I could use some of the plugins on running systems (i.e. without
having to reboot). So in spring 2004 I started searching the Internet
for useful utilities that can be run directly from CD-ROM. These were my
requirements:

-   Must be available free of charge (at least for non-commercial use).
    If source code is available under a Free Software/Open Source
    license, that's even better.
-   Small is beautiful
-   Graphical user interfaces are nice (this is Windows after all...;-)
-   My focus is on diagnostic, network and security tools (no games or
    MP3 players...)

Here's my list. Download the tools, exctract the archives to a folder on
your harddisk and burn them on a CD-ROM. I especially like those cute
[mini DVD-RWs](http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&q=mini+DVD-RW). Or just
put them on your USB-stick. If you leave out all unnecessary files
(documentation, language files, etc.) and compress all executables with
[UPX](http://upx.sourceforge.net/), all these tools together take less
than 100 MB of disk space.

If you have any comments or suggestions write to: mail at dirk-loss de.

### Optional: Use the tools together with PE Builder:

If you want a really nice CD-ROM, start Bart Lagerweij's [PE
Builder](http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/), tell it to include the tools
folder on the CD-ROM (by entering the path as a 'custom directory' on
the start screen) and create appropriate entries for the
[Nu2menu](http://www.nu2.nu/nu2menu/) system. By using PE Builder you
can optionally run the tools from a clean (rescue) system running
completely from CD-ROM. And you have a nice menu that automatically
starts when you insert the CD-ROM into a running Windows system.
